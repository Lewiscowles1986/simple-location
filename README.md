Adds geographic location support to pages and posts.

## Description ##

The goal of this plugin, as the Simple name implies, is to support the 
collection and basic display of location data. 

It does this using the HTML5 geolocation API. As it stores the GeoData in a 
WordPress standard format, GeoData can be also be stored by the mobile 
WordPress apps. It also stores address data which can be optionally retrieved from OpenStreetMap.

It also adds location data to pages, allowing you to create a page about a location.


## WordPress GeoData ##

[WordPress Geodata](http://codex.wordpress.org/Geodata) is an existing standard
used to store geodata about a post.

**It consists of four fields:** latitude, longitude, public, and address.
