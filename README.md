Simple Location
=================

Adds geographic location support to posts using the Wordpress geodata fields. These fields can be filled in by the Wordpress app as well. The goal of this 
plugin, as the Simple name implies, is to support the collection and basic
display of location data. 

Supports HTML5 geolocation API. 

Dreams for the Future  - Add settings page, add functions for display, add functionality to support geolocation with any optional provider, etc.
